# Path Finding Visualizer
A Python-based grid simulation that visualizes how different pathfinding algorithms work.
This project demonstrates A* and DFS Backtracking algorithms with animated movement, obstacles, and step-by-step traversal.

# Technology Used
•	**Python**<br>
•   **Matplotlib** (for visualization & animation)<br>
•   **NumPy** (for grid processing)<br>
•   **Heapq** (priority queue for A*)<br>
•   **Matplotlib Widgets** (Button UI)<br>


# Requirements
1. Install Python (3.8+ recommended)

2. Install required libraries:
    pip install matplotlib numpy

3. Download the project folder.

4. Run the project:
   python path_finding.py

5. A visual window will appear showing: <br>
    •   Grid <br>
    •	Start & Goal <br>
    •	Obstacles <br>
    •	Car movement animation <br>
    •	Next button to switch algorithms (A* ↔ Backtracking) <br>

# Features
✔ A* Pathfinding
Uses heuristics + cost function to find the most efficient path.

✔ DFS Backtracking
Explores paths depth-first with backtracking until the goal is found.

✔ Animated Visualization
The algorithm displays:
    •	Live movement of the "car"
    •  	Path trail
    •	Step counter
    •	Start & goal markers
    •	Visual obstacles

✔ Interactive UI
    •	“Next” button switches between algorithms instantly.
    •	Real-time animation refresh.

Hosting
This project runs locally because it uses Matplotlib UI.
To host or run online, you can use:
    •	Replit (runs Python GUI with virtual window)
    •	Binder / JupyterHub
    •	Local desktop environment
    •	Simply upload the script and run:
            python path_finding.py
