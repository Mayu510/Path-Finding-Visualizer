# Path Finding Visualizer
A Python-based grid simulation that visualizes how different pathfinding algorithms work.
This project demonstrates A* and DFS Backtracking algorithms with animated movement, obstacles, and step-by-step traversal.

# Technology Used
•	Python
•	Matplotlib (for visualization & animation)
•	NumPy (for grid processing)
•	Heap (priority queue for A*)
•	Matplotlib Widgets (Button UI)

# Requirements
1.	Install Python (3.8+ recommended)

2.	Install required libraries:
    pip install matplotlib numpy

3.	Download the project folder.

4.	Run the project:
python path_finding.py

5.	A visual window will appear showing:
    •   Grid
    •	Start & Goal
    •	Obstacles
    •	Car movement animation
    •	Next button to switch algorithms (A* ↔ Backtracking)

# Features
✔ A* Pathfinding
Uses heuristics + cost function to find the most efficient path.

✔ DFS Backtracking
Explores paths depth-first with backtracking until the goal is found.

✔ Animated Visualization
The algorithm displays:
    •	Live movement of the "car"
    •  	Path trail
    •	Step counter
    •	Start & goal markers
    •	Visual obstacles

✔ Interactive UI
    •	“Next” button switches between algorithms instantly.
    •	Real-time animation refresh.

Hosting
This project runs locally because it uses Matplotlib UI.
To host or run online, you can use:
    •	Replit (runs Python GUI with virtual window)
    •	Binder / JupyterHub
    •	Local desktop environment
    •	Simply upload the script and run:
            python path_finding.py
